# SASEHACK-Mental-Health-

This was our submission for SASE Hack 2023, Team: Script Sorcerer, Here is an overview of the project details:

Inspiration:
The inspiration for TheraTalk came from a shared belief in the role of technology to address the growing mental health crisis, especially with busy students. 
We were driven to create a creative solution that provides accessible, non-judgmental support to those who need it the most. 
Drawing inspiration from AI advancements, including ChatGPT, and recognizing the importance of privacy in discussing mental health, we embarked on a short but exciting journey to develop TheraTalk.

What it does:
TheraTalk is a revolutionary mental health support platform for primarily but not limited to students powered by AI. It offers individuals a confidential space to talk about their mental well-being. 
Users can engage in open conversations with our AI chat companion, taking from LlammaIndex's public API for training our chatbot for natural language understanding capabilities. 
TheraTalk listens, understands, and provides guidance 24/7, making it a valuable tool. 
Additionally, our web application incorporates user journaling where users can share there thoughts of their day and save it to their personal account (a personal diary).

How we built it:
Building TheraTalk was a collaborative effort that spanned both the front-end and back-end of the application. 
On the front end, we used a combination of HTML and CSS to create an intuitive and visually appealing friendly interface. 
Our back-end, built with Python, handles the AI-drive conversation our chatbot can have and the user journaling as well. Lastly, we used SQLite to create our database system for user registration.

Challenges we ran into:
Challenges definitely emerged during the development process, several of them testing our skills and determination throughout this hackathon. 
One of the significant hurdles was designing and implementing the database systems for user registration as well as creating the chatbot through incorporating APIs. 
Lastly, merging personal branches and aligning front-end and back-end components also presented a lot of complexities that required careful coordination.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We're immensely proud of our development of TheraTalk with the time frame we had. Our platform is a testament to our shared vision of the future of artificial intelligence and its applications. 
Overcoming the challenges mentioned above was also a significant achievement.

What we learned:
Throughout working on this project, we gained valuable insights into AI technology, front-end development, database systems, and back-end development for web applications. 
We also learned the values of collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability.

What's next for TheraTalk:
Looking ahead, our vision for TheraTalk is to continuously improve and add onto its features. We aim to extend TheraTalk's AI chat capabilities and more features such as motivational quotes. 
Additionally, we want to improve the login/register/home pages for a seamless experience between user and device.
